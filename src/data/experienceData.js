        description: 'This is an intensive and rigorous 12-month full-stack JavaScript web development bootcamp. On a daily basis I worked on fully functional, scalable and progressive web applications. This programme is structured similar to a work environment where I gained real-world experience through a simulated client brief where I and my teammates had to collaborate on agile development projects. I mastered modern web technologies including React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB while implementing industry-standard practices for testing, version control, and deployment. Participated in code reviews, pair programming sessions, and sprint planning meetings to enhance collaborative skills. Developed a portfolio of projects demonstrating proficiency in responsive design, state management, RESTful APIs, and database architecture.'
