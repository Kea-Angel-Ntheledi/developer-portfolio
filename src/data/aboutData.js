    description1: "Hello! My name is Kealeboga Angel Ntheledi. I'm an aspiring Junior Software Developer residing in Johannesburg and Rustenburg.",
    description2: "I am currently a student at CodeSpace Academy, learning full stack development. As part of my studies, I'm working on a capstone project thatâ€™s close to my heart: building a full stack e-commerce website from the ground up. This project allows me to apply everything I've learned in both front-end and back-end development, from designing user-friendly interfaces to creating secure, efficient server-side logic. I'm excited to continue honing my skills and bringing this project to life as the year comes to a close. My goal is to create an engaging, scalable platform that combines functionality with a seamless user experience. Outside of coding, I am a bibliophile who loves not only reading books but also curating a personal library.",
